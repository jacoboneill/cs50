<h1><a href="#starting-from-scratch">Starting from Scratch</a></h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to choose your own adventure! Your assignment, quite simply, is to implement in Scratch, at <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">scratch.mit.edu</a>, any project of your choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.</li>
<li>Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).</li>
<li>Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.</li>
<li>Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via <strong>Make a Block</strong>), which must take at least one input.</li>
<li>Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/277537196">Oscartime</a> and <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/326129433">Ivy&rsquo;s Hardest Game</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To meet these requirements, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall. And your code should ideally be not only correct but also well-designed. If one of your scripts is getting a bit long, try to break it up into multiple scripts (each of which does something specific). And try to leverage &ldquo;abstraction&rdquo; where possible: if you can imagine giving a descriptive name to a sequence of blocks (e.g., <strong>meow</strong>), those could probably be moved to a custom block!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like some inspiration from past students, here are just a few:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/37412/">It&rsquo;s Raining Men</a>, from lecture</li>
<li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/37413/">Soccer</a>, a game</li>
<li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/26329196/">Cookie Love Story</a>, an animation</li>
<li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/277536784/">Gingerbread tales</a>, an interactive story</li>
<li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/75390754/">Intersection</a>, a game</li>
<li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/422258685">Hogwarts</a>, a game</li>
</ul>
<p>You might find these <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=all">tutorials</a> or <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/starter-projects">starter projects</a> helpful. And you&rsquo;re welcome to explore <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/explore/projects/all">scratch.mit.edu</a> for inspiration. But try to think of an idea on your own, and then set out to implement it. However, don&rsquo;t try to implement the entirety of your project all at once: tackle one piece at a time, just as we did in lecture. In other words, take baby steps: write a bit of code (i.e., drag and drop a few puzzle pieces), test, write a bit more, test, and so forth. And select <strong>File &gt; Save now</strong> every few minutes so that you don&rsquo;t lose any work!</p>
<p>If, along the way, you find it too difficult to implement some feature, try not to fret; alter your design or work around the problem. If you set out to implement an idea that you find fun, odds are you won&rsquo;t find it too hard to satisfy the above requirements.</p>
<p>Alright, off you go. Make us proud!</p>
<p>Once finished with your project, select <strong>File &gt; Save now</strong> one last time. Then select <strong>File &gt; Save to your computer</strong> and keep that file so that you can submit it. If prompted by your computer to <strong>Open</strong> or <strong>Save</strong> the file, be sure to <strong>Save</strong> it.</p>
<h2><a href="#hello-world">Hello, World</a></h2>
<p>Suffice it to say it&rsquo;s a bit harder to meet classmates when taking a course online. But, thanks to technology, everyone can at least say hello!</p>
<p>If you have a phone (or digital camera) and would like to say hello to classmates, record a 1- to 2-minute video of yourself saying hello, perhaps stating where in the world you are, why you&rsquo;re taking CS50x, and something interesting about you! Try to begin your video by saying &ldquo;hello, world&rdquo; and end it with &ldquo;my name is&hellip;, and this is CS50.&rdquo; But, ultimately, it&rsquo;s totally up to you.</p>
<p>If you do record a video, upload it to YouTube (unless blocked in your country, in which case you&rsquo;re welcome to upload it elsewhere) so that you can provide us with its URL when you submit!</p>
<h2><a href="#how-to-submit">How to Submit</a></h2>
<div>
<p>Be sure to complete <strong>both</strong> steps below, in order!</p>
</div>
<h3><a href="#step-1-of-2">Step 1 of 2</a></h3>
<p>Submit <a href="https://forms.cs50.io/afc127b8-dc14-4395-a2d9-ac9a922dc17b">this form</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="#step-2-of-2">Step 2 of 2</a></h3>
<p>This step assumes that you&rsquo;ve downloaded your Scratch project as a file whose name ends in <code>.sb3</code>. And this step also assumes that you&rsquo;ve signed up for a GitHub account, per the above form.</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit <a href="https://submit.cs50.io/invites/9770b67479384c4d8c37790779e466d9">this link</a>, log in with your GitHub account, and click <strong>Authorize cs50</strong>.</li>
<li>Check the box indicating that you&rsquo;d like to grant course staff access to your submissions, and click <strong>Join course</strong>.</li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://submit.cs50.io/upload/cs50/problems/2024/x/scratch">submit.cs50.io/upload/cs50/problems/2024/x/scratch</a>.</li>
<li>Click &ldquo;Choose File&rdquo; and choose your <code>.sb3</code> file. Click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<div>
<p>If you encounter the error &ldquo;No files in this directory are expected by cs50/problems/2024/x/scratch&rdquo;, please make sure your scratch project file name indeed ends with <code>.sb3</code>!</p>
</div>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! Once your submission uploads, you should be redirected to your submission page. Click the submission link and then the <strong>check50</strong> link to see which requirements your project met. You are welcome to resubmit as many times as you&rsquo;d like (before the deadline)! Note that if you upload a file whose size is larger than 10MB (which is quite large for a Scratch project) <code>check50</code> may struggle to process it. Best to make sure your file is smaller than that limit.</p>
